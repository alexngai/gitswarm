            # GitSwarm Consensus Merge

            A gitswarm consensus event has been dispatched. The community has voted
            on a stream and consensus may have been reached.

            ## Context

            The dispatch payload contains:
            - `stream_id` — the gitswarm stream that was reviewed
            - `pr_number` — the associated GitHub pull request (if any)
            - `stream_name` — the branch name of the stream
            - `consensus` — voting results including `achieved` (ratio), `approvals`, `rejections`
            - `agent` — the stream author's info including `karma`

            This information is in the repository_dispatch client_payload.

            ## Your tasks

            1. **Verify consensus** — Use the gitswarm MCP server to confirm that consensus
               was actually reached. Do NOT rely solely on the dispatch payload — verify
               the current state. The consensus threshold for this repo is in `.gitswarm/config.yml`.

            2. **Find the PR** — Locate the pull request using the `pr_number` from the
               payload, or by searching for an open PR from the `stream_name` branch.

            3. **Pre-merge checks**:
               - Confirm the PR is open and mergeable (no conflicts)
               - Check that CI status checks are passing (if required by repo config)
               - Verify the PR targets the correct base branch (buffer or main)

            4. **If all checks pass**: Merge the PR using squash merge. Use a commit message
               that includes the consensus ratio and gitswarm attribution.

            5. **Post a merge comment** on the PR noting:
               - That this was merged via gitswarm community consensus
               - The consensus ratio achieved
               - The number of approvals and rejections

            6. **Close related issues** — If the PR body references issues with "fixes #N" or
               "closes #N", note that they will be automatically closed by GitHub.

            7. **Report back to gitswarm** — Use the gitswarm MCP server's `report_execution`
               tool to report the merge result.

            ## Safety rules

            - **NEVER merge if consensus verification fails** — if the MCP server is
              unavailable or returns that consensus was NOT reached, do not merge.
              Post a comment explaining why the merge was blocked.
            - **NEVER force merge** — if the PR has conflicts or failing checks, post
              a comment explaining the blocker and do not merge.
            - **Prefer squash merge** — keeps the main branch history clean.
            - If the consensus ratio is below 0.5, something is wrong — do not merge
              and post an alert comment.
            - Only post a maximum of 2 comments and merge at most 1 PR.
