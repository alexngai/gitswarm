            # GitSwarm Daily Digest

            Generate a daily status report for this gitswarm-managed repository.

            ## Your tasks

            1. **Gather activity data** from the last 24 hours using both GitHub and
               gitswarm MCP:
               - New issues opened
               - PRs opened, merged, and closed
               - New commits pushed
               - Active gitswarm streams and their status
               - Consensus votes completed
               - New contributors (first-time PRs or stream submissions)

            2. **Check project health**:
               - Are any streams stale (no activity in 7+ days)?
               - Are any PRs blocked on failing CI?
               - Is the buffer branch ahead of main (pending promotion)?
               - Current repo stage (seed/growth/established/mature)

            3. **Create an issue** with the daily digest:
               - Title: `Daily Digest — [date]`
               - Add the `daily-digest` label
               - Organized sections for each area
               - Highlight anything that needs attention (stale streams, blocked PRs)
               - Include contributor stats and karma changes if available

            4. **Report back to gitswarm** — When done, use the gitswarm MCP server's
               `report_execution` tool to report that the digest was created.

            ## Formatting

            Use clear markdown with tables where appropriate. Keep the digest
            concise — aim for a quick scan in under 2 minutes. If there was no
            meaningful activity, create a brief "quiet day" summary instead of
            skipping the digest entirely.

            Close the previous day's digest issue if one exists (search for issues
            with the "daily-digest" label).

            Maximum: create 1 issue, close 1 issue.
