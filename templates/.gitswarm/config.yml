# GitSwarm Repository Configuration
# Drop this file in your repo's .gitswarm/ directory to configure
# repo-level settings that sync to gitswarm.
#
# All settings are optional — defaults come from your org settings.
#
# NOTE: Some settings are "server-owned" and can only be changed via
# the API (not this file). These include: agent_access, min_karma,
# ownership_model, is_private, stage, require_human_approval, and
# human_can_force_merge. Setting them here will have no effect.
